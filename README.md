AngularJS Utah Meetup Code of Conduct
=====================================

## Purpose

The AngularJS Utah Meetup believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior. We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, vendors, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

## Scope

We expect all conference participants (sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, vendors, and other guests) to abide by this code of conduct at all meetup venues and meetup-related social events.

## Expected Behavior

* **Be welcoming**. This is an all-inclusive environment where you’re likely to meet people from different types of backgrounds with different points of view and even different programming languages. Everyone should feel welcome at our conference regardless of their technical knowledge or years of experience.
* **Be respectful**, considerate and collaborative. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Help us make this a diverse meetup where people can collaborate and share ideas without fear of backlash or ridicule.
* **Be careful in the words that you choose**. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexual innuendo (including presentation slides)
  * Strong or excessive profanity
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following
  * Harassing photography or recording
  * Sustained disruption of talks or other events
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Inappropriate physical contact or unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and AngularJS Utah is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of AngularJS Utah comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.

Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert meetup organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior by other attendees, organizers, speakers, volunteers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of AngularJS Utah will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in unacceptable behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate including expulsion from the meetup without warning and may possibly face exclusion from future AngularJS Utah events.

## What to do if you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a meetup organizer. Even if you’re not sure, if you encounter something that makes you uncomfortable, please contact a meetup organizer. Every concern will be handled respectfully, privately, and confidentially.

If the matter is especially urgent, please call/contact any of these individuals:

* **Matt Winchester**, Organizer
* **Jason Waters**, Organizer

Meetup organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify any organizer, which can do via:
